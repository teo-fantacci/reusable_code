# Latent state energy profile
This code is meant to apply the approach from this preprint: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10401920/
It aims at exploit the energy profile inferred from the Langevin dynamics of a latent state to quantitavely reproduce the stochastic behaviour of the recorded neurons given as input to the model. 
We plan to apply this tool to a spatial memory and decision-making task of rats in a maze with electrophysiological recording from 3 areas of the cortex. 

# Warnings
The code was meant to work with a previous version of neuralflow (in particular neuralflow 2.0) that now seems to not be available. 
The final plots are preliminary.

# Setup 
In the folder of the repo, open the bash or powershell and install the dependencies typing this command:
'''pip install -r requirements.txt''' 
Then open it in the IDE you prefer (i.e. VSCode), open and run the jupyter notebook "reusable_code_example.ipynb" and run all the cells.
