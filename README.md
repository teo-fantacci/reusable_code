# Latent state energy profile
This code is meant to apply the approach from this preprint: ... to exploit the energy profile inferred from the Langevin dynamics of a latent state to quantitavely reproduce the stochastic behaviour of the recorded neurons given as input to the model. 
We plan to apply this tool to a spatial memory and decision-making task of rats in a maze with electrophysiological recording from 3 areas of the cortex.
